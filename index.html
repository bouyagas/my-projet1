                 <h2>Twitter’s Growth Shifts to Developing Countries</h2>
				<p>But even if the social network is reaching a plateau in many developed countries, it is still spreading like kudzu in Asia and Latin America, according to a new report to be released on Tuesday by the research firm eMarketer. The five fastest-growing countries for Twitter this year will be Indonesia, India, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil, the firm said.Over all, Twitter’s user total is expected to increase 24.4 percent this year to 227.5 million, and grow another 18.5 percent to 269.6 million in 2015, eMarketer said.“Twitter has a lot of runway ahead for growth internationally,” said Debra Aho Williamson, the principal analyst for social media at eMarketer, in an interview.While the research firm’s data is largely in line with recent trends reported by Twitter itself, its estimates of the number of individuals actually using the service are much lower than Twitter’s own publicly reported numbers.For example, eMarketer calculated that Twitter had about 183 million active monthly users at the end of 2013, compared to Twitter’s figure of 241 million.</p>

				<h1>Technology Companies Are Pressing Congress to Bolster Privacy Protections</h1>
				<p>WASHINGTON — A law that allows the government to read email and cloud-stored data over six months old without a search warrant is under attack from technology companies, trade associations and lobbying groups, which are pressing Congress to tighten privacy protections. Federal investigators have used the law to view content hosted by third-party providers for civil and criminal lawsuits, in some cases without giving notice to the individual being investigated.Nearly 30 years after Congress passed the law, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which government officials have interpreted to cover newer technologies, cloud computing companies are scrambling to reassure their customers, and some clients are taking their business to other countries.Ben Young, the general counsel for Peer 1, a web hosting company based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said his customers were keeping their business out of the United States because the country “has a serious branding problem.”“We’ve enjoyed a competitive advantage in Canada,” he said, “because the public perception in the business community is that American law enforcement has more access to data than in other parts of the world.”Places such as Germany, Iceland and Switzerland are trading on a reputation of stronger protections for companies, but such safeguards are not universally tighter than those in the United States. “Some countries are stricter on privacy, and some of them are not,” said Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a technology advocacy group.</p>
